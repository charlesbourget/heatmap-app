# Heatmap-app

Was tired of paying Strava premium to look at the personnal Heatmap so
re-created it as a Desktop Application with Tauri (Rust + Ts).

## How to run

### Required

- rust
- nodejs
- yarn

### Run dev build

```shell
yarn tauri dev
```

### Build production build

```shell
yarn tauri build
```
